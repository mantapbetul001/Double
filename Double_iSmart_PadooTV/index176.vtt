Shankar...

01:28:05.423 --> 01:28:06.506
let's go to the hospital.

01:28:06.673 --> 01:28:07.131
Why?

01:28:07.798 --> 01:28:10.881
If something happens to you,
I can't bear it. Please.

01:28:11.173 --> 01:28:12.423
Hey, there's no time to go to the hospital.

01:28:13.756 --> 01:28:15.798
Shankar, you are pretty sure
that it's memory transfer.

01:28:16.548 --> 01:28:19.173
No one knows what they have put in your brain.

01:28:19.423 --> 01:28:20.256
Listen to me...

01:28:21.464 --> 01:28:22.298
please, Shankar.

01:28:27.256 --> 01:28:29.881
They said my memory would be deleted in four days.

01:28:30.756 --> 01:28:32.881
Before it gets deleted,
I need to tell you something...
