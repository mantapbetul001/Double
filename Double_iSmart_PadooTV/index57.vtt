28:38.631 --> 28:40.631
We are destined to cross each other's path.

28:40.631 --> 28:41.381
How do you say that?

28:42.173 --> 28:44.506
She is going to the same place
as we are, what does that mean?

28:47.048 --> 28:52.006
It means the stars have aligned in such
a way that she finds her way to me.

28:52.381 --> 28:55.964
If she gets down at House
number 6 in front of my house…

28:57.756 --> 28:59.548
I'm going to marry her.

28:59.756 --> 29:01.339
In one year, you'll become an Uncle.

29:01.464 --> 29:02.923
You have already thought about the kids?

29:02.923 --> 29:05.048
Just kids? I am thinking about their school…
