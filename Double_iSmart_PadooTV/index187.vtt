First, find out where he is.

01:33:42.751 --> 01:33:43.168
Hello!

01:33:43.501 --> 01:33:44.543
Is this Parameshwaran?

01:33:44.543 --> 01:33:45.876
Who is this?

01:33:46.376 --> 01:33:47.584
Sir, my name is Jannat.

01:33:47.793 --> 01:33:48.334
Jannat!

01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:50.001
I'm Shankar's girlfriend.

01:33:50.876 --> 01:33:53.126
I heard you are looking for him.

01:33:53.709 --> 01:33:55.751
Can I know why?

01:33:56.376 --> 01:33:57.501
Is Shankar with you?

01:33:57.793 --> 01:34:00.584
He is here, sir, but his condition is not good.

01:34:00.876 --> 01:34:03.626
He's saying something about memory transfer.
