32:31.631 --> 32:33.423
Why did you bring him here?

32:33.506 --> 32:34.339
Very good question.

32:34.923 --> 32:38.173
Humans took thousands of years
to learn to be civilized.

32:38.506 --> 32:44.464
Instead of that, if we teach him our language,
our culture, a little English and computer,

32:44.673 --> 32:49.964
he will teach his entire tribe and within a few years,
the entire tribe will change.

32:50.214 --> 32:51.548
That is my idea.

32:55.548 --> 32:57.464
Why did you tie him like that?

32:57.798 --> 33:00.214
Since he is new to the city, I have tied him up
in order to prevent him from getting lost.
